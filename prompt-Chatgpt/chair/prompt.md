Your task is to create HTML and CSS for the HoverChair website's “hero” section. HoverChair is a hovercraft-inspired desk chair that floats slightly above the ground, providing a comfortable and exciting seating experience.

The hero section should include a main heading, subheading, short description paragraph, and a call to action link styled as a button.

Consider the following guidelines for the code:

- Ensure the code is easy to understand for non-coders by avoiding the use of complex CSS features.
- Use an elegant and neutral color palette, with a focus on earthy tones and subdued hues.
- Document each CSS property you use with a short code comment to explain its purpose.

Your final result should be an engaging and visually appealing hero section that effectively showcases the HoverChair brand.
